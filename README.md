# Durgs_Mortality_Classification_and_Regression
For the this project I have selected the following dataset  from Data.gov “NCHS_-_Drug_Poisoning_Mortality_by_County__United_States”   
About the Data set NCHS is the National Center for Health Statistics. 
This dataset provides an overview about the drug poisoning model based on the death rate at the county level. This is calculated by selecting  demographic as well as at Census Division for drug poisoning from the year  2003 to 2017. The reason for selecting this particular  dataset was it contained categorical and continuous attributes which was important in order to perform classification and regression on the same dataset and also it didn't have any  blank cells.
The Data Set contains 12 attributes namely as follows: - 
FIPS- which represents FIPS Code by County 
Year- From 2003 - 2017 
FIPS State- which represents the State Code 
State- States in the United States 
County- County in the United States 
Population- Population as per each county 
Urban/Rural Category and Census Division  which have  relation between them i.e Each Division has This 6 Category 
Model-based Death Rate- A model was used to estimate the of the death occurred due to drug poisoning 
The remaining  three columns namely Standard Deviation, Lower Confidence Limit,Upper Confidence Limit are Mathematical terms and self Explanatory.
